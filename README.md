# Shakespeak
Project for McHacks 2019

This is a website we built in 24 hours for McHacks 2019. We drew inspiration from [xkcd #1133](https://xkcd.com/1133/) and it's eponymous [The Up-Goer Five Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/). In our 'Shakespeak Translator' text editor, we challenge users to explain technical/modern/weird topics to, well, Shakespeare. That is, we only permit the use of words that were present in any of Shakepeare's works, or are the name of a city/country (this was done with the help of the [Google Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) and its Entity Analysis capabilities).

As of February 3, 2019, our website is live and can be found at:
